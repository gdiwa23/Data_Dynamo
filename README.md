In this project, I worked in a team to ensure the quality and integrity of data before moving on to further analysis. 

This was done by writing SQL queries to inspect the data, engaging with stakeholders to ensure their needs and expectations are understood well, 
filling in a quality control form to ensure traceability,
and finally, creating the table.
